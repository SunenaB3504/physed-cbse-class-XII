# Gap Analysis: Unit 7 (Physiology & Injuries)

## 1. Executive Summary
The current implementation of Unit 7 is **PARTIALLY COMPLIANT**. While the core concepts of Physiology and Injury Management are present, there are specific omissions regarding **Energy Systems**, **Short-term vs. Long-term Effects**, and **Exercise Physiology Data** (exact values for Cardiac Output and Blood Pressure responses).

## 2. Topic-by-Topic Verification

| Master File Topic | Current Implementation | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **7.1 Physiological Factors** | | | |
| Muscle Fibers (Type I/II) | ✅ Present | Match | Listed under Strength/Endurance determinants. |
| **Energy Systems (ATP-CP, etc.)** | ❌ **Missing** | **GAP** | Texts mentions "Energy Reserves" but lacks specific definitions of ATP-CP (<10s), Anaerobic (<2min), and Aerobic systems. |
| Cardio Factors (VO2 Max) | ✅ Present | Match | |
| **7.2 Effects of Exercise** | | | |
| **Short-Term Effects** | ❌ **Missing** | **GAP** | File focuses on Long-term adaptations (Hypertrophy, etc.). Missing "Short Term" specific list (Increase HR, Surge in BP, Tidal Volume spike). |
| Long-Term Effects | ✅ Present | Match | Hypertrophy, Bradycardia, Capillarization are well covered. |
| **7.3 Muscular Effects** | | | |
| Short vs Long Term | ⚠️ Mixed | **Partial** | "Micro-tears" and "Lactate accumulation" (Short term) are not explicitly separated from "Hypertrophy" (Long term). |
| **7.5 Injuries** | | | |
| Soft Tissue (Abrasion etc) | ✅ Present | Match | Definitions match. |
| Bone Injuries (Fractures) | ⚠️ Partial | **Minor Gap** | Greenstick, Comminuted, Impacted are present. **Transverse** and **Oblique** are missing. |

## 3. Data & Formula Check

| Item | Master Value | Current Value | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cardiac Output Formula** | HR × SV | HR × SV | ✅ Match |
| **Resting CO Value** | ~5.0 L/min | Not listed | ❌ Missing |
| **Elite CO Value** | 40 L/min | Not listed | ❌ Missing |
| **Blood Pressure** | Systolic increases, Diastolic stable | Not listed | ❌ Missing |

## 4. SQP & Flashcard Alignment

*   **Fracture Types:** The Master File requires "Transverse" and "Oblique" fractures to be listed.
*   **Sprain vs Strain:** ✅ Covered in Flashcards.
*   **Greenstick:** ✅ Covered in Flashcards.
*   **Abrasion vs Laceration:** ✅ Covered in Flashcards.

## 5. Recommendations
1.  **Add Energy Systems:** Insert a specific bullet point in Section 7.1 detailing ATP-CP, Anaerobic, and Aerobic energy durations.
2.  **Structure Effects:** Split 7.2 and 7.3 content into "Short Term Effects" and "Long Term Effects" sub-bullets to match the syllabus taxonomy.
3.  **Add Fracture Types:** Add "Transverse" and "Oblique" to the Fracture classification list.
4.  **Insert Data Points:** Add a specific flashcard or content note about Normal vs Elite Cardiac Output (5L vs 40L) and BP response.
