# Gap Analysis: Unit 9 (Psychology & Sports)

## 1. Executive Summary
The unit is **moderately compliant (75%)**. While the core "Big Five", "Motivation", and "Aggression" topics are well-covered, there is a **Major Gap** regarding "Sheldon's Classification" (Endomorph/Mesomorph/Ectomorph) which is completely missing from the current `data/unit9.ts` but heavily emphasized in the Master File.

## 2. Topic-by-Topic Verification

## 3. Flashcard & Cheat Sheet Audit

**Missing Content:**
*   **Sheldon's Body Types:** No flashcards for Endomorph/Mesomorph/Ectomorph or their personalities (Viscerotonic etc).
*   **Motivation Cycle:** No mention of the cyclic nature (Need/Drive).

**Existing Content:**
*   OCEAN and Jung are fully covered.
*   Aggression types are fully covered.

## 4. SQP Question Alignment
*   **Self-Talk (2025-26):** Covered in content.
*   **Goal Setting:** Covered.
*   **Personality Dimensions:** Covered.

## 5. Recommendations
1.  **Add Sheldon's Classification:** Insert a new section in "Personality" covering Endomorph (Viscerotonic), Mesomorph (Somatotonic), and Ectomorph (Cerebrotonic).
2.  **Add Motivation Cycle:** Add the specific visualization or content for "Need -> Drive -> Arousal -> Goal".
3.  **Update Flashcards:** Add cards for Sheldon's types (e.g., "What is a characteristic of Mesomorph?").
4.  **Update Cheat Sheet:** Add Sheldon's body types summary.

## 6. Conclusion
The unit is solid on psychology but missing the physiological-personality link (Sheldon).
