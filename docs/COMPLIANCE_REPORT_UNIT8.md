## 1. Syllabus Coverage
| Component | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Newton's Laws** | ✅ PASS | Detailed 1st (Inertia), 2nd (F=ma), 3rd (Reaction) with specific sport examples. |
| **Equilibrium & CG** | ✅ PASS | Static/Dynamic equilibrium and 4 stability principles (Base, CG, Mass, Line) covered. |
| **Friction** | ✅ PASS | Explored Static/Sliding/Rolling and detailed "Necessary Evil" concept. |
| **Projectile Motion** | ✅ PASS | Factors affecting trajectory (Angle, Velocity, Height, Air) fully detailed. |

## 2. Content Depth
- **Flashcards**: 40 items (Target: 30+). Covers definitions, laws, specific friction examples, and stability principles.
- **SQP Support**: 9 Questions (MCQ, Short, Long, Case Study) covering key concepts.
- **Visualizations**: Tables for Friction Management and Newton's Laws.

## 3. Improvements Made
- **Flashcard Expansion**: Added 35+ cards covering specific scenarios (why gymnasts use chalk, why cyclists wear helmets).
- **Case Study**: Added a wrestling scenario to test application of Stability principles.
- **Clarity**: Explicitly defined the "Principles of Stability" which were previously vague.

## 4. Next Steps
- Verify Unit 9 (Psychology & Sports).
