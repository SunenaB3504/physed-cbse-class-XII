# Content Standardization Guide (Based on Chapter 5: Accounting Ratios)

This document serves as the **Master Blueprint** for content generation across all subjects. It analyzes the structure and depth of *Chapter 5: Accounting Ratios* to establish quality standards.

## 1. Section Detail & Hierarchy
**Standard**: Content creates a logical narrative flow from "Basics" to "Complex Applications".
*   **Structure**: `TheoryTopic` (Level 1) → `subtopics` (Level 2) → `points` (Level 3).
*   **Depth**:
    *   **Level 1 (Topic)**: Defines the theme (e.g., "Liquidity Ratios").
    *   **Level 2 (Subtopic)**: Groups related concepts (e.g., "Significance & Interpretation", "Illustration 1 & 2").
    *   **Level 3 (Points)**: detailed bullet points explaining "Why" and "How" (e.g., "*Rule of Thumb*: High inventory turnover combined with low CR...").
    *   **Actionable Insight**: Theory is not just definitions; it includes interpretation guidelines ("High ratio means...").

## 2. Explanation of Formulas
**Standard**: **Zero Abbreviations** in core instructional text.
*   **Method**: All variables in formulas are expanded to their full accounting terminology to prevent ambiguity.
*   **Example**:
    *   ❌ `CR = CA / CL`
    *   ✅ `Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities`
*   **Placement**: Full formulas are provided in the `formula` field of every Illustration object, acting as an immediate reference before the calculation.

## 3. Illustrations & Problem Statements
**Standard**: Self-contained "Concept-Formula-Execution" units.
*   **Components**:
    *   `concept`: Contextualizes the problem (e.g., "Reverse logic uses the mathematical difference...").
    *   `formula`: The specific rule applied in this problem.
    *   `content`: The raw data (Table or Image) presenting the question.
    *   `caption`: Distinct title like "Ill 4: Logic flow for reverse calculation".
    *   `resolution`: **Step-by-Step Logic**. Break down the solution into numbered steps (1, 2, 3...) showing the derivation, not just the final answer.
*   **Quality Metrics**:
    *   **Data Realism**: Use realistic figures (e.g., standard B/S items) rather than abstract variables where possible.
    *   **Diversity**: Include distinct types: Theoretical (Table), Calculation (Table), and Logic Flow (Image/Diagram).
    *   **Complexity**: Progress from Basic Calculation → Component Derivation → Reverse Calculation → Comprehensive Analysis.

## 4. Flashcard Selection Strategy
**Standard**: Comprehensive coverage of the "Knowledge Bloom's Taxonomy".
*   **Quantity**: **Minimum 50+ cards per chapter** (Mandatory).
*   **Categories**:
    *   **Definitions**: "What is X?"
    *   **Theory/Logic**: "Why is X done?" / "Effect of transaction Y?"
    *   **Classification**: "Where is Z shown in B/S?"
    *   **Calculations**: "Formula for A?"
    *   **True/False**: Testing misconceptions.
*   **Goal**: To build muscle memory for 1-mark objective questions.

## 5. Mind Map Content Selection
**Standard**: "Visual Executive Summary" with Deep Hierarchy.
*   **Strategy**: Selects the top 5-6 parent nodes representing the chapter's pillars.
*   **Structure**: **Multi-Level Hierarchy** is mandatory.
    *   **Level 1**: Main Topic (e.g., Solvency Ratios).
    *   **Level 2**: Sub-Topic (e.g., Debt-Equity).
    *   **Level 3**: Key Insight/Formula (e.g., "Total Debt / Shareholder Funds").
*   **Visuals**: Uses distinct colors and icons for mental separation (e.g., Green for Liquidity, Red for Returns).

## 6. SQP & Marking Scheme Representation
**Standard**: **100% Coverage, Verbatim Accuracy** + **AI Enhancement**.
*   **Coverage**: All questions from the source paper must be included. No omissions allowed.
*   **Verbatim Elements**:
    *   `question`: Preserves the exact text, numbers, **tables**, and options (A/B/C/D) from the official CBSE paper. Tables must be formatted using Markdown or HTML to match the original structure.
    *   `markingScheme`: Preserves the official answer key text exactly as published by CBSE.
*   **Formatting**:
    *   Preserves line breaks (`\n`) in long numerical questions.
    *   Preserves formatting of options (a, b, c, d).

## 7. AI Explanation Depth
**Standard**: "The Teacher's Voice".
*   **Purpose**: To bridge the gap between the Question and the Marking Scheme.
*   **Style**:
    *   **Numerical**: Shows the working notes that the Marking Scheme often skips (e.g., "1. Calculate COGS... 2. Apply Formula...").
    *   **Reasoning**: Explains *why* an option is correct and *why* others are incorrect (e.g., "Option A is wrong because...").
*   **Detail Level**: Sufficient for a student to understand the error without referring to a textbook.

## 8. Cheat Sheet Compilation
**Standard**: **Comprehensive Exam-Last-Minute Review**.
*   **Coverage**: Must include every single Formula, Rule, and Limit mentioned in the chapter.
*   **Format**: Organized by topic (e.g., Liquidity, Solvency).
*   **Elements**: Key Terms, Acronyms, and 'Golden Rules' for quick recall.
