*   **Harvard Duration (5 min):** ✅ Included.
*   **Harvard Pace (30 steps/min):** ✅ Included.
*   **Medicine Ball Weight:** ⚠️ Current text is ambiguous ("6lbs/4lbs or 3kg/1kg"). **Action:** Update to enforce "3kg/1kg" as primary.
*   **Senior Dumbbells:** ✅ Correct (8lbs/5lbs).
*   **VO2 Max Formula:** ✅ Correctly written out.

**Common Pitfalls Covered:**
*   **Sit & Reach vs Chair Sit & Reach:** ✅ Distinct topics and definitions.
*   **Push Ups vs Modified:** ✅ Explicitly mentions "Knees touch ground" for girls.
*   **Measurement Units:** ✅ Flashcards mention feet/inches for jumps/throws.

## 4. Recommendations
1.  **Standardize Weights:** Update the `content` text for Barrow Test to prioritize "3kg for boys, 1kg for girls" to align with the Master File's specific instruction.
2.  **Flashcard Tuning:** Ensure there is a specific flashcard asking "What is the weight of the Medicine Ball for girls in Barrow Test?" with the answer "1 kg".

## 5. Conclusion
The unit is 98% compliant. Only a minor text update regarding Medicine Ball weights is required to reach 100%.
