# Compliance Report: Unit 4 (Physical Education & Sports for CWSN)

## 1. Executive Summary
**Overall Status:** 🔴 **CRITICAL GAPS FOUND**
The review of `data/unit4.ts` against `docs/Content_Standardization_Guide.md` and `docs/SOP.md` reveals significant non-compliance, particularly in content volume (Flashcards) and depth (SQP/Cheat Sheet). The structural elements (Visualizations) are present but the "Content Density" is far below the "Gold Standard" established in Unit 2 & 3.

## 2. Detailed Compliance Audit

### A. Flashcard Protocol (Guide §4)
*   **Requirement:** Minimum **50+ cards** per chapter covering Bloom's Taxonomy (Definitions, Logic, Classification, True/False).
*   **Current Status:** **5 cards** total.
*   **Gap:** Missing ~45 cards.
*   **Action Required:** specific flashcards needed for:
    *   **Disability Definitions:** (Intellectual vs Physical vs Visual).
    *   **Organizations:** (Deep dive into Special Olympics Bharat, Paralympics, Deaflympics).
    *   **Strategies:** (Specific examples of modifications).
    *   **True/False:** Common misconceptions about inclusion.

### B. SQP & Marking Scheme (Guide §6, §9 & SOP #9)
*   **Requirement:** 100% Coverage of Past Years (2023-25), Verbatim Question/MS Text, Specialized AI Explanations.
*   **Current Status:** **3 placeholder questions**.
*   **Gap:**
    *   Likely missing 10+ questions from recent SQPs dealing with CWSN.
    *   AI Explanations are generic (1-2 sentences) instead of "Teacher's Voice" (Scoring Strategy, Step-by-Step breakdown).
*   **Action Required:**
    *   Perform OCR/Text search on SQP PDFs for keywords: "CWSN", "Disability", "Paralympics", "Special Olympics", "Inclusion".
    *   Rewrite AI Explanations to include "Teacher's Voice" strategy.

### C. Abbreviations & Professionalism (Guide §2 & SOP #1)
*   **Requirement:** Zero Abbreviations in core text; Professional "Teacher's Voice".
*   **Findings:**
    *   "Sp. Olympics" used in Mind Map labels (Should be "Special Olympics").
    *   "CWSN" used extensively (Acceptable as standard acronym, but full form "Children with Special Needs" should be reinforced).
*   **Action Required:** Expand "Sp. Olympics" to "Special Olympics" in Mind Map/Cheat Sheet.

### D. Cheat Sheet (Guide §8)
*   **Requirement:** Comprehensive "Last-Minute Review" covering all Rules/Terms.
*   **Current Status:** Sparse coverage (3 basic sections).
*   **Gap:** Missing detailed lists of:
    *   Specific Strategies (Equipment vs Rules vs Environment).
    *   Organization details (Founding years, mottos, headquarters - if in syllabus).
    *   Comparison matrices.

### E. Theory Content Depth (Guide §1)
*   **Requirement:** Detailed hierarchy (Topic -> Subtopic -> Points).
*   **Current Status:** Content is present but brief.
*   **Gap:**
    *   "Strategies" section lists generic points ("Modified Equipment"). Needs specific examples found in textbooks (e.g., "Use of bell ball for visually impaired").
    *   **Disability Sports Organizations** section is minimal.

## 3. Remediation Plan
To bring Unit 4 to "Gold Standard":
1.  **Flashcard Injection:** Create 45 new cards targeting specific definitions and logic.
2.  **Theory Expansion:** Enrich "Strategies" and "Inclusion" sections with specific textbook examples.
3.  **SQP Mining:** Scan all available SQP PDFs for Unit 4 questions and ingest them verbatim.
4.  **AI Upgrade:** Rewrite existing and new SQP explanations.
