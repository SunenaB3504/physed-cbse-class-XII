## SECTION 4: SQP Questions & Marking Scheme Gaps

### Current SQP Content: 3 questions
| Year | Q.No | Marks | Type | Status | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-26 | Q1 | 1 | MCQ | ⚠️ GENERIC | Not verified against official paper |
| 2024-25 | Q1 | 3 | SA | ⚠️ GENERIC | Not verified against official paper |
| 2025-26 | Q1 | 5 | LA | ⚠️ GENERIC | Not verified against official paper |

### Critical Issues:
1. **Verbatim Accuracy**: None of the questions are verified as verbatim from official CBSE Sample Question Papers
2. **Insufficient Coverage**: Only 3 questions vs. typical 8-12 questions per chapter in SQPs
3. **Missing Question Variations**: No assertion-reason, case studies, or diagram interpretation questions
4. **No Marking Scheme**: Questions lack official marking scheme reference

### Recommended SQP Coverage (Typical CBSE Pattern)

| Marks | Type | Qty | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | MCQ | 3-4 | Asana identification, disease definition, benefits |
| **1** | Assertion-Reason | 2 | Yoga benefits, asana contraindications |
| **3** | Short Answer | 3-4 | Asana procedures, disease management, benefits |

## SECTION 5: Cheat Sheet Adequacy Analysis

### Current Cheat Sheet: 3 sections
1. ✅ **Asana Identification** - Lists 5 pose names
2. ⚠️ **Common Contraindications** - Lists 4 contraindications
3. ⚠️ **Disease Targets** - Lists 5 organ targets

### Per Standardization Guide: "Must include EVERY formula, rule, and limit"

### Missing from Current Cheat Sheet

| Category | Required Elements | Current | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Disease Definitions** | BMI ≥30, BP >140/90, glucose levels | ❌ | HIGH |
| **Asana Classification** | List by disease (15 total asanas categorized) | ⚠️ Partial | HIGH - Only shown in visualization |
| **Procedure Checklists** | Quick reference for 15 asanas | ❌ | MEDIUM |
| **Contraindication Rules** | Complete list for all asanas | ⚠️ Partial | MEDIUM - Only 4 listed |
| **Benefits Summary** | One-line benefit for each asana | ❌ | MEDIUM |
| **Breathing Techniques** | Pranayama basics integrated | ❌ | LOW |
| **Safety Duration Table** | Hold times, frequency, repetitions | ❌ | MEDIUM |
| **Yoga Sequence Tips** | Order of practice, warm-up, cool-down | ❌ | MEDIUM |
| **Emergency Precautions** | What to do if pain/dizziness occurs | ❌ | LOW |

### Recommended Cheat Sheet Expansion

**1. Disease Definitions Table**
```
| Disease | BMI/Metric | Yoga Benefit |
| Obesity | BMI ≥ 30 | Metabolism regulation |
| Hypertension | BP > 140/90 | Stress reduction |
| Diabetes | Blood glucose | Pancreas stimulation |
| Asthma | Respiratory | Lung capacity |
| Back Pain | Spinal | Flexibility/Strength |
```

**2. All Asanas Quick Reference** (15+ asanas listed with 1-line benefit each)

**3. Contraindications Master List** (Complete matrix)

**4. Sequence Guidelines** (Warm-up → Asanas → Cool-down)

---

## SECTION 6: Mind Map Structure Evaluation

### Current Mind Map Structure
**Root**: Yoga & Lifestyle
- **5 Main Branches**:
  1. Obesity (3 asanas)
  2. Diabetes (3 asanas)
  3. Asthma (3 asanas)
  4. Hypertension (3 asanas)
  5. Back Pain (missing from tree - only 4 shown)

### Issues with Current Mind Map
1. ❌ **Back Pain Branch Missing**: Should have 5th main branch with asanas (Tadasana, Bhujangasana, Shalabhasana, Ushtrasana)
2. ⚠️ **Unbalanced**: Hypertension only has 3 asanas, Back Pain has 4 but not shown
3. ⚠️ **No Third Level**: Missing deeper hierarchy showing asana relationships or procedure steps

### Recommended Mind Map Expansion
- Add **Back Pain** as 5th main branch
- Each asana node should branch to:
  - Duration/Frequency
  - Key Contraindication
  - Primary Benefit
- Add cross-links (e.g., "Ardha Matsyendrasana helps: Obesity, Diabetes, Back Pain")

---

## SECTION 7: Data Structure Compliance (Per SOP)

### Type Safety Review

✅ **Compliant Elements:**
- All chapter data properly typed as `Chapter`
- Topics follow `TheoryTopic` structure
- Visualizations properly typed with `id`, `title`, `type`, `data`
- SQP questions include `id`, `year`, `marks`, `type`, `question`, `answer`
- Flashcards include `id`, `category`, `question`, `answer`

⚠️ **Partial Compliance:**
- SQP questions missing `markingScheme` field (only have `explanation` as `aiExplanation`)
- SQP questions missing `paperType` field (should be "SQP" or "Board")
- Visualization `data` field uses mixed types (array vs. object) - needs consistency

❌ **Non-Compliant Elements:**
- No `contraindications` field at topic level (data buried in visualization table)
- No `duration` or `frequency` fields for asanas
- No `ageGroup` or `condition` fields for safety guidance
- Mind map nodes missing deeper hierarchy for procedures

### Required Type Additions
```typescript
// Add to each topic about asanas
precautions?: {
  duration: string; // e.g., "Hold 30-60 seconds"
  frequency: string; // e.g., "Daily, 5-7 times"
  contraindications: string[]; // List of conditions to avoid
  ageGroup?: string; // e.g., "18-65 years"
  alternatives?: string[]; // If cannot do this asana
}
```

- Specific asana procedures (basic steps correct but missing details)
- Contraindications (listed but need depth verification)

❌ **Not Verified Against CBSE Textbook:**
- Specific asana holding durations
- Exact calorie burn or metabolism improvement percentages
- Specific pulse rate ranges
- Advanced contraindications for medical conditions

### Audit Required:
1. Cross-reference all procedures with CBSE Physical Education Class XII textbook
2. Verify disease metrics (BMI, BP, glucose) with WHO/ICMR standards
3. Validate contraindications with medical literature
4. Confirm asana sequence recommendations with Yoga Sutras/modern studies

---

## Priority Gap Filling Tasks

## Compliance Summary Against Standardization Guide

| Requirement | Status | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| **Section Detail & Hierarchy** | ⚠️ 70% | Topics clear but need deeper procedure breakdowns |
| **Explanation of Formulas** | ✅ 100% | No formulas in yoga, but asana descriptions complete |
| **Illustrations & Problem Statements** | ⚠️ 60% | 8 visualizations present, but 11 critical procedures missing |
| **Flashcard Strategy** | ❌ 10% | Only 5 cards vs. 50+ required |
| **Mind Map Content** | ⚠️ 80% | Good structure but missing Back Pain branch & depth |
| **SQP & Marking Scheme** | ❌ 30% | Only 3 questions, no marking schemes, no verbatim verification |
| **AI Explanation Depth** | ⚠️ 60% | Explanations present but not detailed enough for exam prep |
| **Cheat Sheet Compilation** | ⚠️ 50% | Present but incomplete - missing formulas, rules, limits |

## Content Trap Reminders (Exam Frequently Asked)

1. **Asana-Disease Mismatch Trap:**
   - ❌ Wrong: "Chakrasana is good for diabetes"
   - ✅ Right: "Bhujangasana massages pancreas for diabetes"
   - This confusion appears in MCQs regularly

2. **Contraindication Oversight:**
   - Students often practice asanas that are contraindicated for their condition
   - Example: Person with high BP should avoid Chakrasana

3. **Procedure Order Trap:**
   - Breathing pattern is CRITICAL - wrong breathing nullifies benefit
   - Example: Bhujangasana requires specific inhalation/exhalation sequence

4. **Duration & Frequency Trap:**
   - Many think "more = better" but overholding causes injury
   - Different asanas have different safe hold times

5. **Sequence Logic Trap:**
   - Shavasana MUST be at end (not beginning or middle)
   - Warm-up essential before intense asanas
