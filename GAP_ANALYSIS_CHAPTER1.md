# Gap Analysis: Chapter 1 vs Master Verification File

## Critical Gaps Identified

### **SECTION 1: Content Hierarchy Gaps**

### **SECTION 3: SQP Question Mapping Gaps**

**Current Issue: Questions are GENERIC, not VERBATIM from Official Papers**

| Year | Q.No | Marks | Topic | Current Status | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **2023-24** | Q13 | 1 | League Matches Formula | ❌ NOT INCLUDED | HIGH - Need actual question verbatim |
| **2023-24** | Q14 | 1 | Knock-out advantage | ❌ NOT INCLUDED | HIGH |
| **2023-24** | Q31 | 4 | Case Study: Committees for Guests/Media | ⚠️ GENERIC | CRITICAL - Need ACTUAL case study |
| **2024-25** | Q1 | 1 | Knock-out for 19 teams | ✅ SIMILAR | MEDIUM - Check if verbatim |
| **2024-25** | Q2 | 1 | Assertion/Reason on Knock-out | ✅ SIMILAR | MEDIUM - Check if verbatim |
| **2024-25** | Q25 | 3 | Specific Sports for community | ✅ COVERED | GOOD |
| **2024-25** | Q31 | 4 | Case Study: Boarding/Ceremony/Ground Committees | ⚠️ GENERIC | CRITICAL - Need ACTUAL case |
| **2025-26** | Q1 | 1 | **Double League Formula** | ❌ NOT COVERED | CRITICAL - Missing content |
| **2025-26** | A/R | 1 | Planning as first step | ✅ COVERED | GOOD |
| **2025-26** | Q25 | 3 | League better for judging best team | ⚠️ GENERIC | MEDIUM - Need actual question |
| **2025-26** | Q31 | 4 | Interpret visual fixture | ❌ NOT INCLUDED | MEDIUM - Need case study with visual |

### **SECTION 4: Cheat Sheet & Flashcard Gaps**

**Missing from Current Cheat Sheet:**

1. ❌ **Rounds Formula**
   - League (Even N): N - 1 rounds
   - League (Odd N): N rounds

2. ❌ **Points System**
   - Standard: Winner = 2, Draw = 1, Loser = 0
   - Alternative: Winner = 5, Draw = 3, Loser = 0

3. ❌ **Double League**
   - Formula: N(N-1)
   - Each team plays all others TWICE (home & away)

4. ✅ **Bye Placement Order** - Present but could be more emphasized

5. ⚠️ **Committee Functions** - Present but needs more detail (e.g., Reception, Publicity, Ground, Equipment as separate)

**Flashcard Gaps:**

| Category | Required | Current | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Double League concept | 2-3 | ❌ 0 | HIGH |
| Points calculation | 3-4 | ❌ 0 | HIGH |
| Rounds calculation | 2-3 | ❌ 0 | HIGH |
| Committee Hierarchy levels | 2 | ⚠️ 1 | MEDIUM |
| Combination Tournament | 2-3 | ❌ 0 | HIGH |
| Fixture procedures (drawing steps) | 3-4 | ❌ 0 | MEDIUM |

## Priority Gap Filling Tasks

### **CRITICAL (Must Add)**
1. ✅ Double League - Topic, formula, visualization, 5+ flashcards, SQP coverage
2. ✅ Combination Tournament - Definition, advantages, use cases, 3+ flashcards
3. ✅ Points Calculation System - Table showing Winner/Draw/Loser values, calculations
4. ✅ League Rounds Formula - (N-1 for even, N for odd) + visualizations
5. ✅ Actual verbatim SQP questions with case studies (2023-24 Q31, 2024-25 Q31, 2025-26 Q31)

### **HIGH PRIORITY (Should Add)**
1. 🔴 Committee Hierarchy 3-tier structure visualization
2. 🔴 Fixture drawing procedures (step-by-step for each type)
3. 🔴 Cyclic method worked example
4. 🔴 Staircase method worked example
5. 🔴 Bye placement order visual flowchart
6. 🔴 Committee-specific SQP questions (Reception, Publicity, Equipment committees)

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Could Enhance)**
1. 🟡 More detailed case studies from actual papers
2. 🟡 Visual flowchart for committee hierarchy
3. 🟡 Worked examples for Double League calculations
4. 🟡 Inter-house vs Inter-college examples

## Content Trap Reminders (From Verification)

**These are specifically mentioned as common exam pitfalls:**

1. **Bye Placement Inversion Trap:**
   - Teams (Odd N): Upper Half gets MORE
   - Byes (Odd Nb): Lower Half gets MORE
   - This inversion is INTENTIONAL and tested frequently

2. **League vs Knock-out Confusion:**
   - League = True winner determined (most accurate ranking)
   - Knock-out = Economical & fast (good teams might lose early)

3. **Bye Calculation:**
   - Must subtract N from NEXT HIGHER power of 2
   - Example: 13 teams → next power is 16 → Byes = 16 - 13 = 3

4. **Intramural Pipeline:**
   - Intramural = Mass participation foundation
   - Extramural = Elite selection (not all who participate)
